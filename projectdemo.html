<p> NHS waiting lists have long been a politically salient topic. In the Summer, an analysis published by the IFS found that <a class="textLink" href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/15557"> more than 13 million patients may be awaiting treatment by July 2022 </a>. </p>
<p> My project looks at the relationship between deprivation and the pandemics effect on NHS waiting lists. <p>
    
<h2> Drop in elective treatments. </h2>  
<p> When the pandemic hit, a lot of planned elective care had to be postponed in order to deal with the pressures of coronavirus. This led to a sharp fall in completed pathways. In 2020, compared with 2019, over 4 million fewer elective treatment pathways were completed. </p>

<p> However,  this only tells part of the story. </p>   
<h2> Drop in new pathways started. </h2>
<p> Additionally, there was a sharp fall in the number of people starting new treatment pathways. In 2020, compared with 2019, almost 6 million new pathways were started. This can be thought of as the ‘missing patients’ as represents a key challenge in tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic.  </p>

<p> This chart looks at the relationship between deprivation quintile (explanatory variable) and percentage change in completed pathways from April 2019 and April 2020 (dependent variable). </p>
